			<h2>BURN</h2>
			<br>
			The sky is red, I don't understand
			<br>
			Past midnight I still see the land
			<br>
			People are sayin' the woman is damned
			<br>
			She makes you burn with a wave of her hand 
			<br>
			The city's a blaze, the town's on fire 
			<br>
			The woman's flames are reaching higher 
			<br>
			We were fools, we called her liar 
			<br>
			All I hear is "Burn!"
			<br><br>
			I didn't believe she was devil's sperm 
			<br>
			She said, "Curse you all, you'll never learn!
			<br>
			When I leave there's no return "
			<br>
			The people laughed till she said, "Burn!"
			<br>
			Warning came, no one cared 
			<br>
			Earth was shakin', we stood and stared 
			<br>
			When it came no one was spared 
			<br>
			Still I hear "Burn!"
			<br><br>
			You know we had no time
			<br>
			We could not even try 
			<br>
			You know we had no time
			<br><br>
			You know we had no time
			<br>
			We could not even try 
			<br>
			You know we had no time
			<br><br>
			The sky is red, I don't understand
			<br>
			Past midnight I still see the land 
			<br>
			People are sayin' the woman is damned
			<br>
			She makes you burn with a wave of her hand 
			<br>
			Warning came, no one cared 
			<br>
			Earth was shakin, we stood and stared 
			<br>
			When it came no one was spared 
			<br>
			Still I hear "Burn!"
