			<h1>SMOKE ON THE WATER</h1>
			<br>
			We all came out to Montreux
			<br>
			On the Lake Geneva shoreline
			<br>
			To make records with a mobile
			<br>
			We didn't have much time
			<br>
			Frank Zappa and the Mothers
			<br>
			Were at the best place around
			<br>
			But some stupid with a flare gun
			<br>
			Burned the place to the ground
			<br><br>
			Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
			<br>
			Smoke on the water
			<br><br>
			They burned down the gambling house
			<br>
			It died with an awful sound
			<br>
			Funky Claude was running in and out
			<br>
			Pulling kids out the ground
			<br>
			When it all was over
			<br>
			We had to find another place
			<br>
			But Swiss time was running out
			<br>
			It seemed that we would lose the race
			<br><br>
			Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
			<br>
			Smoke on the water
			<br><br>
			We ended up at the Grand hotel
			<br>
			It was empty, cold and bare
			<br>
			But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
			<br>
			Making our music there
			<br>
			With a few red lights and a few old beds
			<br>
			We make a place to sweat
			<br>
			No matter what we get out of this
			<br>
			I know, I know we'll never forget
			<br><br>
			Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
			<br>
			Smoke on the water
			<br><br>
