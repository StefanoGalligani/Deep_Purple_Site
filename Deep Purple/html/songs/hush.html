			<h2>HUSH</h2>
			<br>
			I got a certain little girl she's on my mind
			<br>
			No doubt about it she looks so fine
			<br>
			She's the best girl that I ever had
			<br>
			Sometimes she's gonna make me feel so bad
			<br><br>
			Hush, hush
			<br>
			I thought I heard her calling my name now
			<br>
			Hush, hush
			<br>
			She broke my heart but I love her just the same now
			<br>
			Hush, hush
			<br>
			Thought I heard her calling my name now
			<br>
			Hush, hush
			<br>
			I need her loving and I'm not to blame now
			<br><br>
			They got it early in the morning
			<br>
			They got it late in the evening
			<br>
			Well, I want that, need it
			<br>
			Oh, I gotta gotta have it
			<br><br>
			She's got loving like quicksand
			<br>
			Only took one touch of her hand
			<br>
			To blow my mind and I'm in so deep
			<br>
			That I can't eat and I can't sleep
			<br><br>
			Listen
			<br>
			Hush, hush
			<br>
			Thought I heard her calling my name now
			<br>
			Hush, hush
			<br>
			She broke my heart but I love her just the same now
			<br>
			Hush, hush
			<br>
			Thought I heard her calling my name now
			<br>
			Hush, hush
			<br>
			I need her loving and I'm not to blame now
			<br><br>
			They got it early in the morning
			<br>
			They got it late in the evening
			<br>
			Well, I want that, need it
			<br>
			Oh, I gotta gotta have it
